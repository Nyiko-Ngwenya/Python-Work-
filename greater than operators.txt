when doing the AND both sides must be true 
when doing the OR one side must be true
when doing the NOT will change one from true to false and vice versa

In numpy arrays we cannot use AND and OR without it flagging an error 
we must use 

//logical_and() to use np.logical(array >20 , array <50)  is similar to array > 20 and array < 50
//logical_or()
//logical_not()

to get the actaul numbers not just true and false // array[np.logical(array >20 , array <50) ]
