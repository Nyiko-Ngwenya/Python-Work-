LIST: 
define// list = []
read // list[x] where x is index from 0
slice// list[0:-1] 
change values // list[x] = new value
changing a subset // list[1:3] = [lisa,dylan]
to add // list + [new values]  or list.append("new value")
to remove // del(list[x])

list [:] means select the whole thing
if x = ['a','b','c']
y = x
y[0] = z
 y is now [z,b,c]
 x is also [z,b,c]
since they are equal to separate and make new list must use the list function
y = list(x) or y = x[:]
list functions // sorted(list, reverse=TRue or false,key) to sort list
	       //list.index('value in list') this will find index of value 
	       // list.count('value in list') to count occurences
	
FUNCTIONS:

sister = 'liz'
str funtions // string.replace("former", "new") this will change the former to the new 
		sister.replace("z","sa") to Lisa

NUmpy arrays 
Can perform function and maath on lists
list_1  = numpy.array(height_list)
list_2 = numpy.array(wight_list)
from this we can can check // bmi = list_2 /list_1 ** 2  
to make array // array = numpy.array(list)
Numpy array can only contain one type whearas list can contain many types
NUmpy subsetting 
USes same index as normal list 

To subset // bmi>20
this will return the same list but as boolean if condition true or false

to only get the actual numbers that fit that 
//bmi[bmi>23] this will get all number which are above the condition but still in the array

2D Arrays
To subset we can get the same as list if 2D
array[first element in list][first element in second list ] or array[first element, second list element]
array.shape will get number of rows and columns

if we want to get all the rows but only one column ion the rows
array[:,0] this means all the rows but only the first column makes it easier to read than array[:][0]
to select where something is equal // newVar = numpyArray == 'what ever we need '
